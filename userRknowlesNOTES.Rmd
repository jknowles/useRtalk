# What is a State Education Agency (SEA)?
- The administrative agency for public education in charge of disbursing funds, monitoring programs, and collecting data on the state of public schools
- Manages and coordinates financial outlays and state and federal programs for schools
- Collects records on all students on a number of dimensions
- Big entity, Wisconsin is a medium sized SEA

# What questions does this pose?
- States and school districts have an abundance of data, but what does it mean?
- Can we do data analysis fast (and accurate) enough to inform decisions that improve student learning and well-being?
- Can we produce analyses that are approachable to policy makers and the public, that galvanize change?
- Can tehse analyses provide results accurate enough to inform decisions timely enough to be used in making decisions?
- Can we do these things in a time of reduced staffing, decreased budgets, and time constraints?


# The Vision
- States and districts have hundreds of attributes (very similar, but not identical) about millions of students in public K-12
- Data is collected often from before school age well past high school graduation
- Patterns can help inform policy choices 
- Simulations can be built to understand the effects of decisions before the decisions are made

# The Joys of Government Work
- Financial constraint
- Time constraint
- Transparency is critical, your work will be reviewed and scrutinized
